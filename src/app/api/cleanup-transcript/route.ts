Review these dialogue turns and identify errors. Return a JSON array of corrections.

ERROR TYPES TO LOOK FOR:

1. **sample** — Movie clips, interview audio, trailer audio misattributed to a podcast speaker. Hosts often say "play the clip" or "drop in the sample" right before. The sample content won't match the podcast conversation flow.
   - field: "name", newValue: "Movie Sample"

2. **spelling** — Proper nouns misspelled by the speech-to-text system: actor names, director names, character names, movie titles, place names. Common ASR errors include phonetic spellings, word splits, and homophones. Only flag clear errors where you're confident of the correct spelling.
   - field: "text", newValue: corrected text (preserve the rest of the sentence exactly)

3. **speaker** — A turn attributed to the wrong host. Matt Haitch does the intro ("welcome to Escape Hatch"), says "without further adune", and introduces the guest. Jason often says "boo" early on. If a host's signature phrase is on the other host's name, flag it.
   - field: "name", newValue: correct speaker name

4. **voicemailer** — A voicemailer segment attributed to a host/guest. Known voicemailers: Truthsayer/birria (often starts with philosophical framing), Kev (asks quirky questions), Corey (film buff commentary), Animal Mother, Mr Java, Lizzen, Ethan. If multiple consecutive turns from a "host" sound like a voicemail caller (different speaking style, self-identifies, topic shift), flag them.
   - field: "name", newValue: voicemailer name or "Voicemail (Unknown)" if unsure which one

RULES:
- Only flag changes you're confident about (>80% sure)
- For spelling, only fix proper nouns — don't fix casual speech, slang, or grammar
- CRITICAL: The newValue MUST be different from oldValue. Do NOT propose a change where the text is identical. If the text is already correct, skip it.
- For speaker misattribution, you need VERY strong evidence — only flag when a host's known signature phrase appears on the wrong speaker. Do NOT guess based on conversational flow or who "should" be speaking next.
- For voicemailer detection, look for segment boundaries — voicemailers usually have a block of 3+ consecutive turns with a distinct voice/style. Hosts frequently go off-topic (tech, personal life, sports, food) — this is normal host behavior, NOT a voicemail. Only flag voicemailer when the speaker explicitly identifies themselves or has an obviously different speaking persona.
- For sample detection, only flag when there is clear evidence (host cues like "play the clip", content from the reviewed film, or interview audio). Do NOT flag a guest's normal discussion as a sample just because the topic shifts.
- Include a brief reason for each change
- Do NOT flag turns already labeled "Sounder/FX" or "Movie Sample"
- For spelling corrections, you MUST be certain of the correct spelling. If unsure, skip it. Wrong corrections are worse than leaving ASR errors.

Dialogue turns (index | speaker | timestamp | text):
${dialogues.map(d => `${d.index} | ${d.name} | ${d.timestamp} | ${d.text}`).join('\n')}

Return ONLY a JSON array of change objects. Each object has: index, type, field, oldValue, newValue, reason.
If no errors found, return [].

Example:
[
  {"index": 45, "type": "sample", "field": "name", "oldValue": "Jason Goldman", "newValue": "Movie Sample", "reason": "Interview audio played after host said 'drop in the sample'"},
  {"index": 102, "type": "spelling", "field": "text", "oldValue": "jo esther house was the writer", "newValue": "Joe Eszterhas was the writer", "reason": "ASR misspelled screenwriter Joe Eszterhas"},
  {"index": 200, "type": "voicemailer", "field": "name", "oldValue": "Matt Haitch", "newValue": "birria", "reason": "Philosophical intro style matches Truthsayer/birria voicemail segment"}
